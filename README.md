 “EXPLORING THE DEEP” Is a project that my self Jacob Fowler, has been working on for around 4 years. I am 17 years and I go to school here in Polson Montana. This project means so much to me because it is a way to explore rivers caves deep and dark depths with out putting human life in danger. That’s why I am working on building a fully functioning UV. (UV) stands for Unmanned Vehicle. The latest UV design will be half the size of a love seat, Approximately 3’ in hight x 5’ in Length.
